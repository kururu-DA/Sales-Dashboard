# Sales-Dashboard

A dashboard to show and analyze sales data over period of time get some insights so can build data-driven decisions.

tools : Microsoft Power BI

based on this visualization i can conclude :
- Most of our sales were in EAST region so we should target most of our product to this region and plan to increase sales in other regions.

- Most Of our sales were in JULY so should maximize our efforts in this month.
- Team A did better than Team B, many efforts required by Team B.
- the scatter chart chart shows negative relation between sales and amount of money spent in Advertising!. i think this chart need to review may be i did something wrong.
